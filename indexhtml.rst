2.58
----

The Blender Foundation and online developer community is proud to present Blender 2.58. This release is the second official stable release of the Blender 2.5 series, and represents the culmination of many years of redesign and development work. `More information about this release <http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-258/>`_ .

What to Expect:

* Big improvements - This is our most exciting version to date, already a significant improvement in many ways over 2.49

* Missing/Incomplete Features - Although most of it is there, not all functionality from pre-2.5 versions has been restored yet. Some functionality may be re-implemented a different way.

• Changes - If you're used to the old Blenders, Blender 2.5 may seem quite different at first, but it won't be long before it grows on you even more than before.
